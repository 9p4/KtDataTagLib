# KtDataTagLib

Little wrapper of the Minecraft's Tag API made to make my life easier. Maybe it will make yours too.

## Installing

build.gradle
```groovy
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
```
```groovy
    dependencies {
        modApi 'com.github.NathanPB:KtDataTagLib:VERSION'
        include 'com.github.NathanPB:KtDataTagLib:VERSION'
    }
```

See the versions [in the releases page](https://github.com/NathanPB/KtDataTagLib/releases)

## Example Usage

```kotlin
class DummyData(tag: CompoundTag) : MutableCompoundData(tag) {
    val counter by persistentDefaulted(0, Serializers.INT)
    val idiotEnum by persistentDefaulted(TestEnum.A, EnumSerializer(TestEnum::class.java)) // Enums require you to manually instantiate the serializer, not big deal
    val nullable by persistent(Serializers.INT.nullable()) // Works with nullable values too
}
```

It works with all the primitive data types and String too, just pick the right serializer

```kotlin
val tag: CompoundTag = stack.orCreateTag // A CompoundTag you got from somewhere, does not matter where it came from
val data = DummyData(tag)

data.counter += 10 // I'll increment this counter because I'm such a random person
println(data.counter) // > 10

// Oh god my counter really incremented how is that possible
```

## Supported Data Types
- Java/Kotlin's primitives (Int, Float, Double, Boolean, Byte, Short, Char, Long)
- String
- CompoundTag
- UUID
- Identifier
- ItemStack
- Enum
- Nullable (Kotlin's ``?``) for all the types above
- List (for all the types above)
- Custom (You can create custom serializers as you wish, its pretty simple to implement. Just look at the existing ones)

## Recommendations
Null safety can turn into a mess if you are not careful with nullable/non-nullable types.

If you wish to use ``persisted`` instead of ``persistedDefault`` make sure to use a nullable serializer too.

If you want to use a nullable serializer, so it may be a good idea to use ``persisted`` instead of ``persistedDefault`` or else you will not get any null values

For more examples check the [example mod](https://github.com/NathanPB/KtDataTagLib/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/dev/nathanpb/example), its really idiot but it helps

## Performance
The performance of this library wasn't tested **yet** and it **may** have problems, I really don't know yet.
